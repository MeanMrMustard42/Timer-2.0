# Timer-2.0
Expanded, more comprehensive version of the Timer class from my old Bank-Account repo. This was committed directly from the Git command line, so anyone *should* be able to do a git pull and download and import it directly into your IDE without any problems.

Also, I don't know why I committed with my other Github account. It doesn't matter, I don't use it anymore.
